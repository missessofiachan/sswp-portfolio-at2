#client

ite-plugin-checker — Runs TypeScript, ESLint, and Vitest checks in a background worker and shows diagnostics in the browser/devtools. Keeps the dev server fast while surfacing errors early.
vite-plugin-svgr — Lets you import SVGs as React components (import { ReactComponent as Logo } from './logo.svg';). Handy since you already have SVG assets.
vite-plugin-pwa — Adds PWA support (service worker, manifest). Useful for portfolio/offline capability and improves UX on mobile.
vite-plugin-compression — Produces gzipped/brotli versions of build assets for servers that can serve precompressed files; simple way to improve production performance.
rollup-plugin-visualizer (or vite-plugin-visualizer) — Generates a bundle visualization so you can identify large deps and optimize them.
@vitejs/plugin-legacy — Adds support for older browsers by generating transpiled fallback bundles (only add if you need IE11/older-target support).

Productivity / DX

unplugin-auto-import — auto-import React, hooks, utils to reduce boilerplate.
unplugin-icons — inline icons as components (works with React).
vite-plugin-svgr — import SVGs as React components (if not already added). Purpose: speed up dev, fewer imports, nicer asset handling.
Linting / Type / Safety (dev-time checks)

vite-plugin-checker — background TypeScript + ESLint diagnostics (already suggested).
@sentry/vite — integrates Sentry source maps and release uploads for runtime error tracking. Purpose: surface errors early and capture production exceptions.
Testing / Coverage

vitest (dev dependency) — test runner that works with Vite.
vite-plugin-istanbul — instrument code for coverage reports when running tests. Purpose: local unit tests and coverage reporting.
Static-site / Routing / Content

vite-plugin-ssg or vite-plugin-ssr — static-site generation for fast portfolio builds.
vite-plugin-mdx — import MDX content as pages/posts. Purpose: static export / content-driven pages for a portfolio site.
Mocking / API conventions

msw (Mock Service Worker) + vite-plugin-mock or vite-plugin-mock-server — mock backend during dev. Purpose: work offline and test UI flows without hitting the real backend.
Build / Performance

vite-plugin-imagemin — optimize images at build time.
vite-plugin-compression — produce gz/brotli assets.
rollup-plugin-visualizer — analyze bundle size. Purpose: reduce bundle size and optimize deploy assets.
Styling / CSS Tooling

tailwindcss (with PostCSS) — utility CSS framework.
vite-plugin-windicss — faster utility-first alternative (if you prefer).
@vanilla-extract/vite-plugin — already present for CSS-in-TS. Purpose: more powerful CSS tooling or alternative styling flows.
PWA & Offline

vite-plugin-pwa — service worker, manifest, caching strategies. Purpose: make your portfolio a progressive web app.
CI / Quality Gates (pre-commit / pre-push)

Husky + lint-staged — run linters/tests before commits.
commitlint — enforce commit message format. Purpose: keep repo quality high and consistent.

Developer experience (DX)

unplugin-auto-import — auto-import React, hooks, etc.; reduces boilerplate (configure in vite.config.ts).
unplugin-icons — inline icon components; pairs with auto-imports.
vite-plugin-checker — runs TypeScript & ESLint in background; add to Vite plugins.
Assets & UI ergonomics

vite-plugin-svgr — import SVGs as React components; use for src/assets/\*.svg.
vite-plugin-imagemin — optimize images at build time; add for production builds only.
PWA & offline

vite-plugin-pwa — manifest + service worker for offline/installable portfolio; small manifest config required.
Mocking & local API

msw (Mock Service Worker) + vite-plugin-mock — mock backend during dev; good for UI dev without the server.
Performance & build tooling

vite-plugin-compression — produce gz/brotli assets for precompressed hosting.
rollup-plugin-visualizer (or vite-plugin-visualizer) — analyze bundles, run conditionally for --analyze.
Testing / Coverage

vite-plugin-istanbul — coverage instrumentation when running tests with Vitest (or use built-in Vitest coverage).
(Vitest is already present — keep)
CI / Quality gates

husky + lint-staged — run linters/format on staged files to keep commits clean.
commitlint (optional) — enforce commit message style.
Monitoring / Sentry

@sentry/webpack-plugin or @sentry/vite (if you want error reporting and source-map uploads in CI).

I'll list practical, repo-appropriate Node modules you can add, grouped by purpose, with one-line reasons and a short install suggestion.

Checklist

Provide a categorized list of useful modules (done).
Give a compact install command for a recommended subset (done).
