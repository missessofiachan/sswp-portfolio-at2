Here’s a prioritized improvement plan tailored to what’s in your repo.

Critical Fixes

CI filename: .github/workflows/ci.xyml:1 → rename to .yml so GitHub Actions runs. Replace tabs with spaces and add pnpm cache and workspace-aware scripts.
Duplicate Vite configs: client/vite.config.js:1 and client/vite.config.ts:1 conflict. Keep one (prefer vite.config.ts) and remove the other + vite.config.d.ts.
Unauthorized route: client/src/features/auth/RequireAuth.tsx:1 redirects to /unauthorized, but no route/page exists. Add client/src/pages/Unauthorized.tsx and route in client/src/app/routes.tsx:1.
Axios redirect duplication: client/src/lib/axios.ts:30 sets window.location.href twice. Keep one redirect using LOGIN_ROUTE (line 30) and remove lines 31–33.
Error handler header: server/src/api/middleware/error.ts:1 has a broken/merged JSDoc before imports. Clean the comment and keep a single export function errorHandler(...) definition.
Security & Secrets

Secrets hygiene: The service account example file test1-795d3-...json is ignored (good). Keep it untracked; add a note in README.md about scrubbing from history if accidentally committed.
Env validation: Good Zod schema (server/src/config/env.ts:1). Consider lazy-loading env inside handlers that need it (e.g., JWT middleware) to improve testability, but optional.
CORS in prod: server/src/app.ts:1 currently origin: true. Use an env var to restrict in production (e.g., CORS_ORIGIN, fallback to http://localhost:5173 for dev).
CI/CD

Workflow content: Update renamed .github/workflows/ci.yml to:
cache pnpm: setup-node cache + pnpm-store action
workspace-aware runs: pnpm -r run lint, pnpm -r run test, and pnpm -r run build
set DATA_STORE=memory, JWT_SECRET for server tests
add a build job to ensure client + server build.
Root scripts: package.json:1
add build: npm --workspace client run build && npm --workspace server run build
add check: npm-run-all lint typecheck test
change lint, test to use monorepo runs: pnpm -r run lint / pnpm -r run test
Engines: add "engines": { "node": ">=18 <=22", "pnpm": ">=9" } to root for consistency.
Testing

Client tests: client/test exists but empty. Add client/vitest.config.ts with environment: 'jsdom', setupFiles: ['test/setup.ts']. Add a smoke test for AuthProvider and route rendering.
Server tests: You have a good integration flow (server/src/test/integration.test.ts:1). Fill or remove the two describe.skip placeholders to avoid noise.
Coverage: Enable Vitest coverage in both packages (thresholds modest), report in CI.
Frontend Improvements

Placeholder files: replace files named like comments (e.g., client/src/api/clients/# tiny API clients (axios)) with README.md inside the folder, or remove.
Meta and a11y: client/index.html:1 add <meta name="description" ...>, Open Graph tags, and correct title. Ensure images have alt text (you already do in Admin).
Unauthorized page: Add a simple page explaining access requirements.
State/data: Consider adopting TanStack Query (you have lib/query.ts stub) for caching and stale-while-revalidate on product lists and detail pages.
Styling: You’re using vanilla-extract; consider dark-mode preference sync with prefers-color-scheme and storing theme in localStorage.
Router cleanup: client/src/app/routes.tsx:1 “products/new” just redirects; either restore a dedicated create page or remove the route and rely on Admin.
Backend Improvements

Admin endpoints: Great split under admin.routes. Add rate limiting for auth and uploads in production.
Uploads validation: server/src/api/routes/uploads.routes.ts:1 checks MIME; also validate file extension against MIME and consider running basic image sniffing for safety (optional for assignment scope).
Logging: morgan('tiny') is fine; skip in tests via if (process.env.NODE_ENV==='test').
Firestore scripts: server/scripts/\*.js hardcode a SA path. Accept GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_FILE env and fallback to your current path so they’re portable.
Error model: Your error handler is correct; optionally standardize error shapes and use next(Object.assign(err, { status })) in controllers/middleware for consistency.
Repo Hygiene

.gitignore dedupe: Root .gitignore:1 repeats log/dist blocks; simplify and ensure uploads/ is ignored (it’s untracked now).
Remove stray placeholder root files: server/# Express + TS + NoSQL data layer and similar comment-named files under client/src and server/src/domain (replace with folder README.md).
Docs file names with spaces are fine; consider kebab case for portability if you like.
Developer Experience

ESLint unification:
Root has .eslintrc.cjs (classic, React) while client uses ESLint 9 flat config. Choose one approach. Easiest: remove root React rules and let client own its ESLint; add a server-specific ESLint config (Node, TS) or a monorepo flat config with per-package overrides.
Ensure the package providing eslint is installed where lint runs from (root), or call pnpm -r run lint.
Pre-commit checks: Add Husky + lint-staged to run eslint --fix and prettier --write on staged files, and typecheck on commit or push.
Node/TS: You can set "moduleResolution": "NodeNext" and consolidate target/lib across the repo (currently OK as-is).
Performance & UX

Client build:
Add bundle analyzer on demand (e.g., rollup-plugin-visualizer, run with --analyze).
Consider vite-plugin-pwa for offline and installable portfolio feel.
Images: Add build-time optimization (vite-plugin-imagemin) for production; ensure uploaded images are sized reasonably client-side before upload.
Production headers: Serve frontend via a platform that supports compression and caching; configure gzip/brotli and cache-control.
Deployment

Docker: Add server/Dockerfile and .dockerignore to containerize API; optional docker-compose.yml for running API + a local emulator (if you use Firestore emulator).
Health checks: You already have /api/v1/health; wire it into deployment health checks.
Documentation

README polish: You have great structure. Add a short “Troubleshooting” and “Known Issues” (e.g., JWT expiry means re-login, memory store resets).
Fill out docs/ASSESSMENT.md, and ensure evidence screenshots list maps cleanly to your Features.
API docs: A lightweight OpenAPI YAML in docs/openapi.yaml would be a strong plus; or at least example requests/responses per endpoint (you already have a Postman collection).
Quick Wins (do first)

Fix CI by renaming .github/workflows/ci.xyml and updating workflow to run monorepo tasks.
Remove one Vite config in client/ and keep vite.config.ts.
Add Unauthorized page + route; fix axios duplicate redirect (client/src/lib/axios.ts
–33).
Clean .gitignore duplication and ensure server/uploads/ stays ignored.
Add minimal client smoke test and client/vitest.config.ts.
Add root build and check scripts.
Add CORS env config for production.
Replace stray “comment-named” files with README.md placeholders.
